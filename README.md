# 🪟 Yet Another Store for Winget

> A modern, premium GUI wrapper for the **Windows Package Manager** (`winget`) package manager.

## 🚀 Why this exists

Let's face it: command line package managers are incredibly powerful, but we all suffer from command amnesia. Who hasn't spent five minutes searching help docs or stackoverflow just to remember the exact syntax to clean the cache, pin a package, or list unneeded dependencies?

**Yet Another Store for Winget** brings all that CLI power into a stunning, native-feeling graphical user interface. No more forgotten commands, no more syntax errors. Just pure, visual package management.

## ✨ Features

- **Visual Package Explorer**: Search, filter, and inspect packages with ease.
- **One-Click Management**: Install, update, pin, and uninstall without opening the terminal.
- **Smart Terminal Output View**: See the exact commands being run under the hood (great for learning or troubleshooting).
- **Command Reminder Companion**: Keep track of history and custom scripts.

## 🔗 Official CLI

This application is an unofficial graphical frontend. It runs standard CLI commands behind the scenes.
- **Official Website/Repository**: [Windows Package Manager](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)

## 🛠️ Requirements

- The `winget` command-line tool must be installed on your system and available in your shell's `PATH`.

## 🧑‍💻 Building from source

> **Status**: the code scaffold is rolling out across the suite (yas-brew first).
> The commands below are the standard YAS build flow and will work as soon as
> the scaffold lands in this repository.

git clone https://github.com/albertolicea00/yas-winget.git
cd yas-winget
cmake --preset default        # configure (Ninja, Debug)
cmake --build --preset default
