# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## Development Setup

> **Status**: the code scaffold is rolling out across the suite (yas-brew first).
> The commands below are the standard YAS build flow and will work as soon as
> the scaffold lands in this repository.

### Prerequisites

1. **Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools** (Desktop development with C++): https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
2. **CMake + Ninja**: `winget install Kitware.CMake Ninja-build.Ninja`
3. **Qt 6.7+** with [aqtinstall](https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall): `pip install aqtinstall` then `aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.7.3 win64_msvc2022_64 -O C:\Qt` (or use the official Qt Online Installer). Point CMake at it with `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt\6.7.3\msvc2022_64`.

The `winget` CLI itself must also be installed — the app is a GUI wrapper around it.

### Build environment

C++/Qt has no virtualenv; isolation comes from **out-of-source builds**: everything generated lives under `build/` (git-ignored) and the "environment" is pinned by `CMakePresets.json`. To reset the environment completely, delete `build/` and configure again.

```bash
cmake --preset default          # 1. configure — creates build/default
cmake --build --preset default  # 2. compile
ctest --preset default          # 3. run tests
.\build\default\yas-winget.exe
```

### Project structure

- `src/core/` — vendored YAS core (process runner, queue, models, controller). Kept identical across all YAS repos; if you fix a bug here, please mention it so the fix can be replicated suite-wide.
- `src/` — the winget adapter (command builders + output parsers) and `main.cpp`.
- `qml/core/` — shared design system and app shell (also vendored).
- `qml/` — app entry (`Main.qml`: brand accent + tag).
- `tests/` — QtTest unit tests; adapter parsers are tested against recorded CLI output.
